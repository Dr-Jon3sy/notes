## Project Notes

### SkyDaddy

Honestly the name is already pissing me off, will have to work on that

Learning about apps...by having chatGPT do it all for me. Woot. 

Honestly its a bunch of things that I've done before or know how to do but haven't strung together all in one. Be good to get something running as a service that actually sees the front end. 

#### Images in Readmes

Fun fact - ```png``` and ```jpg``` images, because of variations in how transparency (sp) is handled, can differ...mostly by ```png``` images looking blue. Love that. 

60% keyboard I'm using is great until it isn't - specifically backtick and tilde characters are an annoying combination (```FN-ESC``` and ```FN-SHFT-ESC``` respectively). Which is fine...until you're in markdown, or on Linux again and being able to use the alias to home is REALLY FREAKING NICE.
